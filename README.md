# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

There are 256 ElementaryCellularAutomaton. 

# Todo
convert from uint256 to uint8. This may help with storage but more importantly it will allow for a clearer demonstration of how the algorithm works.
